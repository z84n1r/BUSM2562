Task 2 | Academic articles
Point value
Our client, Healthy Burgers!, is particularly interested in discussing the proposed benefits of a fruit and vegetable subsidy.
You are required to research, find, and choose five (5) of the   latest articles discussing "fruit and vegetable subsidies”. Please only focus on academic articles by using Google Scholar   material and only from the year 2000 onwards. (Please use RMIT Harvard referencing style).It is important that you provide us with an overall summary on top of the bibliography highlighting what criteria you use to pick the most relevant 5 articles. The internet is full of information, and this can be either a good thing or a bad thing. Being able to discern the difference between high quality and low-quality information is very important. Finally, for each article provide a brief explanation (up to 100 words) as to why you think we need to include it in our literature review.

代做程序编程语言r client is interested in highlighting to the government that taxes are generally   associated with a loss to society. To do so, please create two demand and supply diagrams to show the effects of a "tax".
In the first diagram show consumer and producer surplus with not tax.
In the second diagram introduce the tax and identify consumer surplus, producer surplus, government revenue, and the deadweight loss.
Below, using three (3) dot points briefly summarise what happens to consumer and producer surplus and relate that summary to the deadweight loss.

Client profit
Task 5 | Client profit
Point value
In a recent meeting between the government and our client’s CEO, the government has deemed that Healthy Burgers actually specialise in producing a range of unhealthy (high fat, high salt, high sugar) products. This mean that as far as the government is concerned a proposed “fat tax”, rather than a fruit and vegetable subsidy, would apply to their products.
Using a simple equation tell us how the tax influences Healthy Burger’s profit. Discuss what happens to prices, quantity, and costs. Please do so in no more than 150 words.
